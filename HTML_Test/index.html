        <h1>Desperation</h1>
        <p>I want to talk a little bit about my current <strong>situation</strong>. It is something that has been
            causing me a substantial amount of distress lately. This problem involves my relationship
            with a very special person for me. Let me tell the whole story, from the very beginning to
            where I am currently at.
        </p>
        <p>Her name is Rara. I had been friends with her for three years when she made her move and tried to
            approach me. To be clearly honest, I had never been in a serious relationship before, so I didn't really
            know how to act in that situation. Since I was quite fond of her company, I accepted it, and we
            started some kind of a very close, romantic friendship. We never bothered to clarify what our relationship actually meant, and
            it was partially my fault for not asking her out directly. But we were quite fine with it. At least I was.
        </p>
        <p>In late April, I started to have some doubts regarding our relationship. I did something that hurt her, and she
            changed dramatically. Perhaps I am a little bit oversimplifying this part and downplaying what I did to her. I am
            not going to sugarcoat it: I ghosted her for three days and then reappeared as if nothing happened. She was, understandably,
            devastated by my foolish action. She had been treating me as if I were the most important and special person in the
            world for her, yet I treated her as if she were nothing. I can't imagine the pain and distress she must've gone
            through, the uncetainty and the anxiety she must've endured during those three days without me. I now understand 
            what she felt back then. But I am getting a little bit ahead of myself right now.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, I tried to reconcile our relationship when I realized that I wanted to be together with her for longer,
            yet the damage had already been done. She had changed. She no longer saw me as a priority in her life. She had dramatically
            cut down on her effort to show her affection to me. I was, undoubtedly, very hurt by this. It was a massive shock
            going from feeling like I was loved to feeling like the love was waning. It hurt. I tried everything I could, but
            nothing seemed to have any effect on her. At this point, she was still relatively close with me. We still contacted
            each other everyday via WhatsApp, and things looked fine, aside from her decrease in affection. But everything gradually
            went worse. She became even more distant, colder than she had ever been. Now she only replies briefly to my long messages.
            The worst part is that she recently admitted that she has been talking with other people. I don't know how to handle this. 
            I am currently under a lot of stress right now because I am convinced that I am about to lose her. She is applying for
            a scholarship abroad, and last time I heard she succeeded in getting accepted into the prestigious Japanese private Kansai University.
            I have nothing to offer her that I can leverage to perhaps make her stay. <em>Nothing</em>. I am a terrible, lazy person who
            has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>In an attempt to win her back, I am currently trying my best to define a clear career path for myself. I started
            to look for job openings and getting into job seeking. I started learning to code in order to improve my CV and perhaps
            increase my chance to get employed, even though my major in university was electrical engineering.
