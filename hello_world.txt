Hello, World! This is my second commit to the GitHub repository.
I am still trying to wrap my head around this whole version control thingy.
From what I've managed to glean so far, Git is a version control system that allows you to keep
a record of the whole state of your repository at certain points in time. This is useful to
document the progress of the code and it makes simpler to roll back changes once a problem
arises. I am going to save the changes I've made to this text file and commit it to my GitHu
repository.
